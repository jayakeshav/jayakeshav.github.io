<BaseLayout title="Jaya Keshava Chandra Kotha">
  <p>I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at UC Irvine with a focus on low-level systems. My work spans computer architecture, security, and teaching, and is grounded in understanding how real systems behave under practical constraints.</p>

  <p>My research examines how microarchitectural attacks can be detected at runtime using hardware performance counters, particularly on systems that are already deployed and difficult to change. I am interested in approaches that work in practice rather than idealized models or clean-room assumptions.</p>

  <p>Alongside research, teaching plays a central role in how I think about systems and explanation. I care about building understanding step by step, connecting concepts across abstraction layers, and making complex mechanisms understandable without oversimplifying them. This perspective also shapes how I reason about systems design and evaluation.</p>

  <p>This website is a working space rather than a polished showcase. It brings together my research, publications, projects, teaching materials, and notes. Some content is complete, while other parts reflect ideas in progress.</p>

  <p>If you are here for my technical work, the Work section provides an overview of research, publications, and systems projects. If you are interested in how I teach and explain technical material, the Teaching and Notes sections offer more context. The About page provides a broader personal background.</p>
