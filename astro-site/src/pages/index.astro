  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at UC Irvine with a focus on
    low-level systems. My work spans computer architecture, security, and
    teaching, and is grounded in understanding how real systems behave under
    practical constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research examines how microarchitectural attacks can be detected at
    runtime using hardware performance counters, particularly on systems that
    are already deployed and difficult to change. I am interested in approaches
    that work in practice rather than idealized models or clean-room
    assumptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside research, teaching plays a central role in how I think about
    systems and explanation. I care about building understanding step by step,
    connecting concepts across abstraction layers, and making complex
    mechanisms understandable without oversimplifying them. This perspective
    also shapes how I reason about systems design and evaluation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is a working space rather than a polished showcase. It brings
    together my research, publications, projects, teaching materials, and
    notes. Some content is complete, while other parts reflect ideas in
    progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are here for my technical work, the Work section provides an overview
    of research, publications, and systems projects. If you are interested in
    how I teach and explain technical material, the Teaching and Notes sections
    offer more context. The About page provides a broader personal background.
