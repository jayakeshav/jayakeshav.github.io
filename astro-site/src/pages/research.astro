  <h3>Research</h3>

  <p>
    My research focuses on detecting microarchitectural and transient execution attacks at runtime using hardware performance counters. I study these attacks across heterogeneous platforms, including Intel and ARM systems, using data-driven and machine-learning-based techniques.
