  <h2>Current work</h2>

  <p>
    This section collects my research, publications, and projects in one place. Rather than a single narrative, it is organized to reflect different stages and forms of work—from ongoing research directions, to published results, to systems and tools built along the way. Together, these pages provide multiple entry points into how I think, build, and evaluate ideas.
  </p>

  <h2>How to navigate this section</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Research</strong> — my research agenda, core questions, and
      ongoing lines of inquiry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Publications</strong> — peer-reviewed papers, preprints, and
      released datasets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Projects</strong> — experimental frameworks, measurement
      infrastructure, and supporting systems.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you are new to my work, I recommend starting with the
    <a href="/work/research">Research</a> page.
