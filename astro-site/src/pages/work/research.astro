  <h3>Research</h3>

  <p>
    My research explores runtime detection of microarchitectural attacks
    that exploit hardware features such as speculative execution, cache
    hierarchies, and branch prediction. I focus on detection mechanisms
    that can operate on existing systems, particularly those that cannot
    easily adopt new hardware or invasive software defenses.
  </p>

  <h3>Research threads</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Runtime detection of transient execution attacks</strong><br />
      Leveraging hardware performance counters to identify malicious
      behavior that has bypassed traditional mitigations.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Performance counter semantics across architectures</strong><br />
      Understanding how counter behavior differs across Intel and ARM
      platforms and how these differences affect detection reliability.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data-driven detection pipelines</strong><br />
      Designing feature representations and machine learning models that
      operate on noisy, low-level hardware measurements.
    </li>
  </ul>

    These research threads are supported by the publications and projects
    described in the other sections of this Work area.
