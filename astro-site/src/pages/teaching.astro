<BaseLayout title="Teaching · Jaya Keshava Chandra Kotha">
  <p>I have served as a teaching assistant for courses in digital logic, computer architecture, and computer software at UC Irvine, working closely with students across a wide range of backgrounds and levels of preparation.</p>

  <p>My teaching starts with understanding rather than formalism. I try to anchor new ideas in concepts students already recognize and guide them through the reasoning process, so learning feels constructed and deliberate rather than memorized.</p>

  <p>I believe that any complex topic can be understood by deliberately building toward it, rather than by treating knowledge as something that can only be accessed after completing a fixed set of prerequisites. Concepts do not exist in isolation; ideas in the world are deeply connected and interrelated, and learning becomes more meaningful when those connections are made visible.</p>

  <p>When I think about understanding, I think in terms of a connected mental network or mesh rather than isolated mental models. New ideas need anchor points to attach to, and without those anchors learning becomes free-floating and fragile. In my teaching, I try to ensure that students have the necessary reference points in place so that new concepts integrate naturally into an existing structure.</p>

  <p>In practice, this means breaking complex mechanisms into smaller components, using concrete examples and visual reasoning, and encouraging students to explain their thinking as part of the learning process. I am particularly interested in teaching low-level and technical material in ways that reduce intimidation and cognitive overload.</p>

  <p>I also welcome anyone who wants to learn or understand a concept more deeply to reach out to me. As long as I understand a topic myself, I am confident in my ability to explain it clearly and help build the foundation needed for others to grasp it.</p>

  <p>This section collects teaching-related materials, reflections, and resources, including discussion notes, problem-solving approaches, and course support content. Some material is tied to specific courses, while other content reflects broader ideas about teaching, learning, and explanation.</p>
